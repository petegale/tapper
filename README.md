Tapper
======

Tapper is used for counting switch tapping frequency for measuring cognitive load in usability tests.

Tapper uses Resin.io and their wifi-connect module, and handles all the serving of pages and timing of stuff in Node.

Usage:
Turn on the Rpi - if it has wifi crednetials, it will connect automatically, if not, it will create an access point (TapperAP) to allow you to connect and configure wifi.

Once connected - open a browser on the IP address of Tapper to manage file recording and viewing.
